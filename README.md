Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Assignment1
=====================================

1. please make sure the DataDir contains data 
2. In order to accerate the executing speed, I add the DataCache.fg to function so that it need not read data each time    (but the first time is not avoided....). You can set DataCache.fg=T to enable that as execute.R described (defalt is false).
3. The X-axis label of the trend charts in each png file was using local words(Traditional Chinese), it could be changed if re-executing on your machine which was setup to local time zone.
